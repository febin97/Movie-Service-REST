Add an endpoint to search trackByName. Understand @Query and parameter passing to @Query

Generate API documentation using Swagger 2

Create custom exceptions TrackNotFoundException, TrackAlreadyExistsException in a com.stack....exceptions package. Perform appropriate exception handling and propagation back.

Running Logic on Startup in Spring. Create seed data to pre-fill the database with movie information whenever the application starts. Use both approaches: Approach 1: ApplicationListener Approach 2: CommandLineRunner (Find out how it differs from ApplicationRunner)

Use @Primary and @Qualifier annotations to specify which implementation to use. 11. Use @Profile to run the application with the existing service implementation, and the new TrackDummyServiceImpl implementation.

Swap in-memory H2 database with MySQL.
Create two additional properties file application-dev.properties that contains configuration for H2 and application-prod.properties that contains configurations for MySQL.
